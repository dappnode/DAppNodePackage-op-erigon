# DAppNodePackage-op-erigon

OP-erigon is a minimal fork of the `erigon` Ethereum client. In the OP environment, OP-erigon acts as the Execution Engine, which is responsible for executing the blocks it receives from the rollup node and storing state. It also exposes standard JSON-RPC methods to query blockchain data and submit transactions to the network.
